          The incidence of lyme disease has been increasing in recent years.  Data was reviewed for the entire United States but the primary focus was on New Jersey.  This was because New Jersey has a higher prevalence of lyme disease than many other states and it is local to our team.
       

          Our team identified the following as areas for research in determing trends for the incidence of lyme disease:<br>
            <br>Is lyme disease more common in counties with higher deer populations?
            <br>Does deer hunting / population control reduce lyme disease?
            <br>Is warm weather a predictor in the following year's lyme disease rates?
            <br>Do oak mast years cause an increase in lyme disease the following year?
         
            <br>
            <br>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        The team completed many tasks to finish the project.  The initial step was data gathering.  This was done through web scraping and downloading relevant files that were available.  These datasets were reviewed and in some cases eliminated from being included in our research.
        <br><br>
        The next task was to clean the data that was kept from the data gathering.  This included formatting changes, as well as continuing to remove unnecessary data.  The cleaned data was saved in .csv files for loading into the database.
        <br><br>
        The remaining tasks were to create and populate the database, design the overall web site flow, create visualiztions and analyze the data to draw conclusions.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        Many tools were utilized in this project, including:
        <br>
        <br>Jupyter Notebook
        <br>Pandas
        <br>Bootstrap
        <br>d3.js
        <br>leaflet.js
        <br>Flask
        <br>Postgres
        <br><br>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>      
        There were some limitations in researching this topic.  The main limitations were:
        <br>
        <br>Data was not completely available for all counties and / or years for NJ.
        <br>The number of ticks in an area wwas not available, just if a tick presence was established.
        <br>Lyme disease cases were based on residency of the affected subject rather than where it was contracted.
